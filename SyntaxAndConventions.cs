 // Syntax is the structure of the language. Like using semi-colons to end sentences. Indenting the code makes it easier to read though it isn't neccessary. Comments are used to make notes for yourself or people you are working with.
//  Conventions are the guidelines for a specific programming language. They recommend the style, practices, and methods for every single aspect written in that particular language.
